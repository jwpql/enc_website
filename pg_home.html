	9/28 (check in 1): the website has basic functionality. The links work. I know how to format pages and embed images now 
	(even if the current design is very... minimal). I also figured out clickable tabs + how to upload websites online.
	In the future, I want to work on the actual content (text, image assets, art) for the site. I want to make it look niver. 
	I'm thinking about making this an archive for a personal worldbuilding project.
	I should also figure out the organization of the website. If I have time at the end, I could attempt mobile compatibility.

            An automaton made with sacred wood from the Nemetonan Grove. 
            She acts as the grove's keeper as well as the guardian of the enarby village of []. 
            A quiet, contemplative individual, she fits the role of wise, unbiased idol perfectly.
            <br><br>
            She was created by an unnamed Old God as part of the push to create artificial life. 
            Being unable to synthesize consciousness from scratch, Fortune's consciousness is derived from that of a sacred tree's. 
            Fortune knows little about herself beyond that, having been powered off for most of her time in the Old World. 
            Centuries later, she would awaken in the New World as part of the Nemetonan Grove, the forest having become a New God.

        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Fortune is a tall automaton with long black hair, yellow eyes, and pale skin. 
            There is a crack on the left side of her face, while the right side of her face is obscured by hair and yellow flowers, which seem to grow out of her body. 
            Her midsection is made out of wood, with a metal cage-like structure in the stomach area. 
            The same flowers grow out of her midsection and adorn her hair. 
            She is typically seen wearing a short yellow jacket with large, puffy sleeves. 
            Her legs are plated with a yellowish metal and have visible ball joints.

        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Calm, gentle, and philosophical, Fortune seems like the ideal of a forest guardian. 
            She was told by her creator to protect the grove, and fulfills this task the best she can, playing the part of a wise, unbiased idol. 
            In reality, she only has as much knowledge as she has seen and read and inferred. 
            She has a vague sense of identity, lacking likes, dislikes, and hobbies outside of being a New God. 
            She tends to take a passive role in life. 
            She fears looking too deep into her identity may reveal that she is not fit for the role of god, depriving her of the only place she has ever known and belonged to.
            <br><br>
            Fortune is naturally curious; this can occasionally override her sense of responsibility. 
            She studies and reads about nature for the sake the townspeople, but enjoys it greatly. 
            She wants badly to know about her own origins.

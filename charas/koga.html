            A prominent artist who lived in <a href="../world/taiyue.html">Taiyue</a>. 
            Known for spearheading the Sanguism movement, which was known for bold strokes, 
            limited colors, and depictions of the raw human experience. 
            His work often included performance elements inspired by live art, usually featuring
            himself as the performer.

            Koga is a tall, well built man with tan skin. 
            He has white hair with a longer red layer underneath. 
            The red layer is usually braided in two sections, with each braid reaching his ankles. 
            He has two red horns on top of his head. 
            His arms and legs are red with white stripes. 
            He is usually seen wearing loose, white pants and a red necklace.
            <br><br>
            He is supposed to have two moles under his right eye, regardless of whatever mistakes may be present in the art. 
        </p>
        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Despite his intense art, Koga has a friendly and patient personality. 
            He is outgoing and enjoys drinking and going to sports games. 
            He takes pride in his work, refusing to be ashamed of his methods or subject material. 
            He tries not to let art overtake his personal life; 
            however, as art turns from a hobby into something more serious, 
            he finds that more and more difficult.
            <br><br>
            Koga is usually a genuine, open person. 
            He has never been good at hiding his emotions, 
            nor does he have any problems with being honest. 
            His authenticity is part of his appeal as an artist. 
            However, as his career progresses, 
            he finds himself unconsciously developing a public persona that is increasingly 
            what others expect him to be- audacious, erotic, and confident. 
            His personality, in turn, affects how others interpret his art. 
            Koga sometimes misses the simple honesty of the past; 
            on the other hand, he finds it safer to distance himself rather than face parasocial 
            fans and scathing critics as his true self.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Koga grew up in the countryside and often went to Taiyue to sell vegetables. 
            He took up art as a hobby after meeting Mengxi. 
            As an adult, he began hosting small exhibits and shows in his free time, 
            and gained a small amount of fame. 
            In an era defined by the desire to transcend the dust and dirt of humanity, 
            many found his blunt and realistic depiction of the human form refreshing and powerful. 
            <br><br>
            Eventually, one of his shows was attended by <a href="yuan.html">Yue Yuan</a>. 
            When word of this got out, it catapulted him into the top of the Taiyue art scene. 
            His work was controversial and unpopular, but would eventually spawn Sanguism, 
            an artistic movement that emphasized the human form.

        <p style="padding: 20px;padding-bottom:0;">
            Koga and Mengxi were childhood friends who lived in the same village. 
            Mengxi inspired his interest in live art and the human form. 
            However, they fell out in their teens over Mengxi's lack of ethics. 
            Koga despises her methods of coercing people into being subjects for her art, 
            and thinks she is ruining the reputation of art that includes living elements. 
        </p> 
        <h3 style="padding-left: 20px;"><a href="yuan.html">Yue Yuan</a></h3>
        <p style="padding: 20px;padding-bottom:0;">
            Yuan first approached Koga with no intentions beyond expressing interest in his work. 
            Though he has mixed feelings on his fame, 
            Koga is grateful for Yuan for the opportunities they gave him. 
            They are on distant but friendly terms.

            An obscure New God who wanders the world, seeing the sights and learning as much as he can.  
            His curiousity and clear mind have made him quite capable, despite his lack of divine talent. 
            A stubborn, solitary person, he sees himself as an outsider to gods and mortals alike, preferring to indirectly express himself through art. 
            <br><br>
            He was once a struggling human artist who craved recognition who lacked the skill and insight as a mere human to make anything meaningful. 
            He has since given up on fame and understanding. 
            He travels alone, leaving behind anonymous art installations depicting an era forgotten by time.

            Mela was born into a mostly human family. 
            Generations ago, one of his ancestors received a blessing from the Earth, gaining fivine talent in fire-related crafts, such as ceramics, smithing, and cooking. 
            The gift had become watered down through generations, however. 
            Most descendants were only exceptional at one or two crafts. 
            Mela's parents were potters who moved to Taiyue hoping to expand their business; however, business was not as successful as they had hoped. 
            Mela himself was born without any sort of talent; as a result, his parents paid little attention to him, affording him a great deal of freedom. 
            He was inspired to become an artist after seeing one of Yuan's paintings in the town square. 
            After significant effort learning and practicing the craft, he was accepted into art school. 
            He spent four years there, barely managing to graduate.
            <br><br>
            After graduating, he traveled away from Taiyue hoping to earn fame away from the shadow of his family. 
            However, he was never satisified with his work, questioning his motive for pursuing art. 
            In the end,

        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        An art curator and creator well known in certain circles of the Taiyue art scene, 
        Mengxi was primarily known for her late night exhibits showcasing the injury or 
        vivisection of live subjects. 
        Though her work was considered taboo, 
        her influences can be seen in many contemporary art movements.
        </p>
        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        Mengxi has a lighthearted and nonchalant personality, 
        and never seems to take anything seriously. 
        She generally regards other people with a sense of boredom and mild amusement. 
        However, she is very passionate about certain things, such as her art. 
        Making art is one of the few occasions where she feels alive, 
        which is apparent in her giddier, more manic mannerisms. 
        While hosting exhibitions or doing live demonstrations, 
        she takes on a theatrical, sadistic persona.
        </p>
        <h1>Backstory</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        She grew up in the countryside, where her parents owned a farm. 
        She was always fascinated when it was time to slaughter the animals. 
        She was quite gifted academically, 
        and would go to Taiyue for her higher education in medicine. 
        There, she would discover the underside of the city's renowned art scene, 
        and become part of it.
        <br><br>
        She mainly sources animals from the markets. 
        She pays people to participate in her exhibit, 
        usually leaving out crucial details like "it will hurt a lot and be really invasive and awful." 
        Sometimes her subjects knew about her work beforehand and are into it; 
        most of the time they are simply desperate for money. 
        It is questionably legal but many law enforcement officials enjoy her work, 
        and are thus willing to turn a blind eye.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 20px;padding-bottom:0;">
            Estranged friends. Koga cut off ties due to her questionable artistic ethics, 
            but she really isn't bothered by it.

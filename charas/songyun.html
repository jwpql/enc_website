        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        A bubbly but volatile singer/hostess who worked at the Jade Garden teahouse. 
        She came to Taiyue months after the city was established.
        </p>
        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        Sweet and considerate, 
        Songyun is popular among teahouse goers. 
        She can be somewhat airheaded, but it only adds to her charm. 
        She dreams of a peaceful life where she can grow old with someone she loves.
            <br><br>
        Songyun believes that humanty is inherently cruel, 
        and the peace she dreams of can only be achieved by pretending. 
        Thus, whenever people try to get close to her, 
        she feels the need to test their willingness to pretend by gaslighting, 
        emotionally manipulating, and generally being terrible to them. 
        She doesn't have many friends.
        </p>
        <h1>Backstory</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        Songyun was born in Yanghai, a country to the north of <a href="../world/taiyue.html">Taiyue</a>. 
        She was the accidental product of an abusive, dysfunctional marriage. 
        She spent most of her time busking on the street to help keep food on the table.
            <br><br>
        At fifteen, was noticed by a retired courtesan for her voice, 
        who offered to train her at her school. 
        Songyun happily accepted, leaving her home behind forever. 
        She was somewhat successful at her training. 
        She was pretty, and had a natural talent for music. 
        However, her lack of education but her far behind the other girls 
        when it came to learning poetry, as was expected of respectable courtesans. 
        At nineteen, she was sent to Taiyue at the recommendation of her teacher, 
        where she would work as a waitress and performer.
        </p>
        <h1>Relationships</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 20px;"><a href="yuan.html">Yue Yuan</a></h3>
        <p style="padding: 20px;padding-bottom:0;">
           Moving to Taiyue was not Songyun's decision. 
           She distrusts the patron deities of the new city, 
           believing them to be too idealistic. 
           Once they see what humanity is capable of, they'll surely leave the people to die.

            One of the most well-known artists in <a href="../world/taiyue.html">Taiyue</a>. 
            Their art perfectly captures traditional ideals- it is flowery and delicate, 
            with themes that are abstract and intangible. 
            They has transcended worldly matters, or so they believe.

        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Tao Lin was born into great wealth, and taught from birth to continue the family legacy. 
            She is a polite, refined person with a short temper she does her best to hide. 
            She takes immense pride in her work and adores attention.
            <br><br>
            While they are outwardly gracious, 
            their inner monologue is quite judgmental and opinionated. 
            She has strong ideas on most things in life 
            and will not hesitate to tear into someone when asked for feedback. 
            Hardworking and blunt, she always gives her best and acts like it. 
            She's carrying the weight of an ancient lineage, after all. 
            It would be unacceptable to seem ashamed of it.

        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Tao Lin is descended from dragons, 
            a species that preceded humanity by several thousand years. 
            Her ancestors were one of the first to settle in Taiyue. 
            Their art, which was inspired by extinct dragon civilization, 
            greatly influenced the culture of Taiyue. 
            The Tao Institute of the Arts is one of the most prestigious schools in the city. 
            They are one of the few remaining ancient lineages.
            <br><br>
            From birth, Tao Lin was trained to take on the mantle of family head. 
            As an adult, she works as the headmaster of the Tao Institute for the Arts. 
            She also sponsors many artists.

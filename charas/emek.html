        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Emek appears as a young man with white skin and short white hair. 
            He has a pair of white wings drowning from either side of his head. 
            His most notable features are his skeletal limbs; his arms, hands, legs, and wings are made of bone. 
            His forehead and nose bridge are tinted orange, and his blue eyes have a dark ring around them. 
            His appearance is based on that of a mute swan.
            <br><br>
            Emek tends to wear modest, concealing clothing. 
            His main outfit consists of a dark gray long-sleeved button down, gray pants, black and orange boots, and a loose black outer robe. 
            He occasionally wears black gloves.
        </p>
        <h1>Personality</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Emek is a sociable, direct individual. 
            He has an immature sense of humor and casual way of speaking, often misusing slang terms in an attempt to seem cool. 
            He gets along well with most of the townspeople, often playing ball with the youth or drinking at the pub. 
            He is confident in his powers, treating threats on Lasid like trivial matters. 
            Despite this, he can be quite insecure. 
            Emek cares greatly about appearing composed and in control, never expressing genuine fear or sadness. 
            When his control is stripped away, he tends to lash out and throw himself recklessly at the problem. 
            More than anything, he hates being pitied. 
            <br><br>
            Emek’s issues likely comes from his past as a hostage. 
            For the first few decades after being freed, Emek was a recluse who hated going outside and being seen. 
            He held a deep hatred for humans, who had cut off his limbs, and only stayed out of obligation to the Empress. 
            He forced himself to reacclimatize to society to feel normal. 
            In the present, his anger and reclusiveness are for the most part in control; however, certain events can lead him to spiral. 
            He often goes to graveyards alone to hone his necromancy.
        </p>
        <h1>Bakcground</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Prior to the New World, Emek lived in with others of his species on an unnamed sky island. 
            On the moment of the Failed Rapture, the island fell to the sea. 
            Emek himself, having become a New God, eventually washed on shore on the shore by [].
            <br><br>
            Dying without the presence of a god, the people of [] quickly recognized Emek for what he was. 
            They cut off his arms, legs, and wings to prevent him from escaping, and placed him far from any life. 
            Emek suffered in this state for five years, until he was found the [diplomat]. 
            The diplomat offered to kill Emek’s captors for him. 
            In return, Emek would stay at the city, which would become part of the Aetesian Empire. 
            Wanting nothing but to watch his captors suffer, Emek agreed.
            <br><br>
            At some point afterwards, Emek found the bones of his severed limbs.
            He uses his necromancy pwoers to control them to perform basic motor functions. 
            He would eventually reacclimate to society, though the scars of his past never fully faded away.

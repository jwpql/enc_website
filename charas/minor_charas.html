		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			Characters that have yet to be added or have insufficient information to warrant a page.
			<ul>
				<li>Empress- Holy Vessel, ruler of Aetesian Empire, Basil's mother. 
					Emotionless, expressionless, the reason Basil is so afraid of becoming a god.</li>
				<li>Aestesian diplomat- Empress' right hand (man? woman?), recuited new gods for empire.</li>
				<li>An Tai- Aeon, co-ruler of Taiyue with Yuan. Nicer and more sociable than Yuan, 
					took care of diplomacy stuff. More science inclined but also didn't believe in separating science and art.</li>
				<li>Mountain god cult leader- Vessel that looks like a mountain but the tunnels are weirdly fleshy and moist. 
					Mountain range isolates Heartglade (village) from everywhere else. It demands human sacrifices. 
					Uses human vessels to communicate with people.</li>
				<li>Kit- teenager chosen to be Mountain God's successor (vessel) who runs away out of fear and joins a theater. 
					Charming, loves attention, cripplingly insecure and wracked with guilt.
				</li>
				<li>Moon- Vessel that travels around in a boat for delivery and trading purposes. 
					Earned nickname because their constant route around the continent is like the moon's orbit.
				</li>
				<li>Southern Stars- Vessel that is a school of glowing white fish. Fish die if you take them out of the group. 
					Predictable migration cycles.</li>
			</ul>

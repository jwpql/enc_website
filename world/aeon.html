    <h1>Aeon</h1>
    <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            A rare type of being that existed in the <a href="old_world.html">Old World</a>. 
            It referred to any immortal who that is handcrafted by the <a href="creator.html">Creator</a>. 
            In other words, Aeons are gods have no parents and can never reproduce. 
            <br><br>
            The first known organisms were Aeons. 
            New to creating life, the Earth created lifeforms that had no corporeal body and no way to die. 
            Quickly, It realized that a way for organisms to die was essential to managing mana. 
            These primordial Aeons persisted throughout the Old World, consuming the area around them to leave it barren. 
            Afterwards, all Aeons were created with a way to cease existence, though they could not die naturally. 
            Because they tend to require extremely high mana, they were the first to die as the Old World ended. 
            <br><br>
            As unique and rare creatures, Aeons have no culture of their own. 
            They often adopt the culture of nearby civilizations, or keep to themselves and make their own rules. 
            Many people welcomed them, seeing Aeons as minor gods or extensions of the Creator.
            <br><br>
            Notable Aeons included:

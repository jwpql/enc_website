        Periods of time in the <a href="old_world.html">Old World</a>. 
        Defined by the type of dominant lifeform on Earth at the time. 
        One can think of it like different periods in an artist's career. 
        <br><br>
        Despite the names, not all lifeforms during a period adhere to one body plan. 
        For example, birds were created in the Draconic period despite not being reptilian.

        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            The last generation to be created. 
            Broadly speaking, humanoid species are weaker and shorter lived compared to their older counterparts. 
            In exchange, they require less mana to survive. 
            <br><br>
            The most prominent humanoid species were the demihumans. 
            Out of all humanoids, they had the greatest ability to use mana. 
            Deeply rooted in their culture was the shame of being human; 
            popular trends in fashion, art, and building all imitated those of older, greater species. 
            Interactions with "lesser" humans were to be avoided. 
            They made great advancements in medicine while trying to surgically augument their own bodies.
            <br><br>
            Truly mana-less humanoids were rare. 
            However, some humanoid species required so little mana that, in the mana-abundant Old World, they might as well have required none. 
            These humanoids were considered an oddity by older species. 
            Why would the Creator give such a powerless species sapience? 
            These beings, once called dehumans, were treated with confusion at best, outright cruelty at worst. 
            Some sought to elevate themselves through augmentation prcedures or divine blessings. 
            Others found pride in their lack of magic, and beauty in the machines they invented to compensate for it. 
            <br><br>
            As the Creator slowly died, mana levels dropped dramatically, killing most of the older species. 
            In the end, dehumans made up the majority of surviving sapient life. 
            Over time, they became to be known simply as "humans."

        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            [WIP] Like their redecessors, they relied entirely on mana to survive. 
            They contain primitive organs that do not seem to serve any purpose.

        <h1 id="amorphous">Amorphous Iteration</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Beings that had solid, albeit changing bodies. They deformed their body using mana to move, eat, and build.
        </p>

        <h1 id="incorporeal">Incorporeal Iteration</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Incorporeal beings made of pure mana. The first beings to have free will. 
            Includes the first and last creations incapable of death. The Earth learns from its mistakes.

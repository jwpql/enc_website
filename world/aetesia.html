        One of the most prominent organizations in the  Common Era, the Aetesian Empire is an alliance of Holy Vessels led by <a href="../charas/empress.html">The Empress</a>.

            The Aetesian Empire is located on the western side of the continent. 
            Most of the region has a mild climate, with dry summers and cool winters. 
            <br><br>
            Since the region has a denser population of Holy Vessels than other countries, it has higher mana levels in the environment than average. 
            The region is well known for rare plants and animals. 
            Most notable among them is the Imperial Eagle, which are bred in hatcheries in Avos. 
        </p>
        <h1>Government</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Despite its name, the Aetesian Empire is more like a confederacy of city-states. 
            Every village, town, and city must agree to a contract in exchange for benefits such as access to trade routes and military support. 
            The contract establishes basic rights of each person and god, duties of the rulers, and obedience to the Empress. 
            It also links each Vessel's mana to a pool shared between contract holders and the Empress, a special ability exclusive to the Empress. 
            Traveling inspectors routinely stop at cities to check the conditions there, and report concerns to the Senate. 
            Although rebellions have happened, these are rare due to the Empress' control over the mana link. 
            Breaking the contract allows the Empress to take much of the offending god's mana through their link, dooming their city's inhabitants and causing immense pain to the god.

            Creator deity of life on Earth. Its body is the planet itself. 
            It forges life within its molten core, and releases them into the world through the Aortic River. 
            Interchangably referred to as the Creator and the Earth.

        <h1 id="mana">Mana</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
            Energy that emanates from the core of the planet. 
            Most lifeforms on Earth rely on it to survive. 
            <br><br>
            If you had never seen a heart before, could you design one from scratch? 
            Could you craft and balance every biological system to create a living creature? 
            The Creator was far from omniscent, and used mana to bridge these gaps between function and form. 
            For a long time, organisms did not even need physical bodies. 
            As the planet became more populated, though, mana became more scarce. 
            This necessitated the creation of lower mana beings with organs. 
            <br><br>
            Some creations are able to use mana themselves. 
            Borrowing the Creator's power, they can perform feats that defy the laws of nature. 
            However, the extent and range of these powers can never exceed what they were created with.

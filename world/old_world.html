        "Old World" is the umbrella term given to the era prior to the death of the <a href="creator.html">Great Creator</a>. 
        It was characterized by higher and more stable levels of mana, allowing for a variety of supernatural species and lifeforms to exist. 
        The Creator also actively created new lifeforms, most of which were crawled out of the Aortic Spring. 
        It is unknown how long this age lasted, with the oldest records dating back several millenia. 
        It ended with the failed rapture, leading up to the death of the Creator on year 0.

        It was announced roughly three months in advance, by prophets at the Aortic Springs. 
        It was followed by increasingly severe symptoms, including: 
        <ul style="margin-top:0;">
            <li>Sunscorching- the sun became harsher, with even brief exposure burning the skin with cold heat.</li>
            <li>Cessation of weather patterns such as rain and wind, leading to crop failure and famine.</li>
            <li>Extreme temperatures in day and night.</li>
            <li>Widespread disease with no discernable cause or cure.</li>
        </ul>

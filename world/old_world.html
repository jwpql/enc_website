        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        "Old World" is the umbrella term given in the Common Era to the time period prior to the death of the <a href="creator.html">Creator</a>. 
        It was characterized by higher and more stable levels of <a href="creator.html#mana">mana</a>. 
        Different lifeforms require different levels of mana to survive, which high mana organisms exhibiting greater power and supernatural abilities. 
        In the beginning, the Creator handcrafted every lifeform. 
        They emerged from the planet's core through one of the Aortic Springs, and crawled from its banks. 
        Eventually, It learned to make lifeforms that could reproduce on their own, leading to the world as we know it. 
        It is unknown how long this age lasted, with the oldest records dating back several millenia. 
        Eventually, the Creator began to shows signs of decline. 
        Mana levels on Earth gradually lowered, culminating in the failed rapture- the moment the Creator died. 
        However, bits of its power would anchor themselves to the living beings that survived, preserving a low level of mana in the world and allowing some life to continue; 
        this marks the start of the <a href="new_world.html">Common Era</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>Death of the Creator</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        The final moments of the Old World. 
        It was announced roughly six months in advance, by prophets at the Aortic Springs. 
        Over these months, the habitablity of the planet plummeted. 
        The sun became harsher, with even brief exposure burning the skin with cold heat. 
        Weather patterns became volatile, ceasing entirely in some regions. 
        Temperatures became more extreme, with scorching days and freezing nights. 
        A widespread, fatal plague emerged, with no discernable cause or cure and symptoms including weakness, internal bleeding, nausea, and hair loss. 
        <br><br>
        During this time, civilization fell into chaos. 
        The most influential individuals- typically high-mana lifeforms and Aeons- were the first to die. 
        Left without leaders, some prepared for a dignified death alongside, believing that all things, even the Creator, must come to an end. 
        Others lamented the Creator's passing, thinking that it was due to the sins of the creations. 
        More were unconcerned with the theological implications, and simply held on day by day, not wanting to die. 
        They huddled by the banks of the Aortic River, where the effects were least severe, and prayed.

        Era after the death of <a href="creator.html">the Creator</a>. Also called the Human Age or more rarely, the New World. <br><br>
        The moment the Creator died, fragments of its power, freed from the god, tethered themselves to some of Earth's remaining creations. 
        This unexpected development allowed low-mana life to continue within a fixed radius of these new gods known as Vessels.

        <h1>Holy Vessels</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
        Also known as New Gods, Holy Vessels are beings who hold the remnants of the Creator's power. 
        They emanate some amount of mana- the force that used to emanate from the planet's core and sustained life. 
        Highly sought-after individuals, as life can only exist in their vicinity. 
        Most are confined to staying at a single town or village, sometimes by contract but often by force. 
        There seems to be no discernable pattern in who was "chosen" to be a god; Holy Vessels can be humans, animals, plants, or even groups of lifeforms. 
        <br><br>
        Notable Vessels include:

	9/28 (check in 1): the website has basic functionality. The links work. I know how to format pages and embed images now 
	(even if the current design is very... minimal). I also figured out clickable tabs + how to upload websites online.
	In the future, I want to work on the actual content (text, image assets, art) for the site. I want to make it look nicer. 
	I'm thinking about making this an archive for a personal worldbuilding project.
	I should also figure out the organization of the website. If I have time at the end, I could attempt mobile compatibility.
    <br/> <br/>
	10/1: I figured out how to make the background change when I click tabs!!!!! I drew characters and added them to the link on the right.
	I'm really proud of the art! The page kind of breaks when the screen is not 1080x1920, though. I should fix that at some point. 
	<br/><br/>
    10/8: I've been really busy, so not much time (or energy) to code. I've been working on non-code things, though. I drew around 4 new 
	backgrounds and made a website mock up on google slides to plan out the formatting.
	<br/><br/>
	10/19: I've been looking into how to make an image gallery. Clicking on the images could open the image in another window, or it could 
	trigger a modal. The modal code looks confusing. I would have to learn Javascript. A third programming language seems a bit much, but 
	I could definitely copy and modify some code on the internet though. Right now the gallery is very simple. You can right click and open the
	images in a new tab for a better view. <br>The website review assignment also made me think about website 
	design. I originally wasn't planning on a very elaborate navigation system (since the site isn't practical so much as it's an experience 
	in my vision). However UI elements like navigation bars are still important, so I added one. Also added a logo (I will draw it later).
	<br/><br/>
	11/7: decided to try more wiki style for website, made template for character page. most pages can be made from that. tempalte page isnt accessible thru main website right now.
	<br/><br/>
	11/8: modified template, added character specific gallery template. Added RUDIMENTARY media query, site is slightly less unnavigable on tall screens. Added banner image.

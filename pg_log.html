		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			12/6: I've been focusing on adding more pages and info.. will be a long journey because I'm not good at worldbuilding. 
			Added a custom 404 page. Also added comments to my code
		</p>
        <hr></hr>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			11/25: fixed gallery formatting, added 3 character pages and some other empty placeholder pages. 
			I'm going to have to write... so much... 
			Also added a logo and some more images. 
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			11/12: Added footer. I don't know if I need one but I like it. 
			No idea how to do the copyright thing but I doubt it matters. 
			Also I drew a bunch of character icons, not sure if they're necessary but they look cute and are fun to make.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">
			11/19: I finished most of the website base, including templates for different kinds of pages. 
			I've also been working on mobile compatibility. 
			Resizing the window on my laptop triggers the desired effects, but opening the website on my phone doesn't? 
			Other than that, the main task left is to upload and add content to the website. 
			I plan to do this over Thanksgiving break. 
			I like working on this website. 
			After this class ends, I might continue updating it. 
			I could learn Javascript and make a gallery with properly working modals. 
			I also had an idea to add fake ads around the website.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			11/8: Modified template and added character specific gallery template. 
			A lot of wikis have a separate gallery page for each entry. 
			I draw a lot so I figured I should make one. 
			Added RUDIMENTARY media query (code that changes website layout depending on window size). 
			Site is slightly less unnavigable on tall screens. Added banner image. Drew buttons for home page. 
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			11/7: I felt like my original idea lacked a solid direction, so I decided to try a wiki style for website. 
			I made template for a wiki page, with a sidebar and main body. 
			Most pages can be made from that. The template page isnt accessible thru main website right now, though.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			10/19: I've been looking into how to make an image gallery. 
			Clicking on the images could open the image in another window, or it could trigger a modal. 
			The modal code looks confusing. I would have to learn Javascript. 
			A third programming language seems a bit much, but I could  copy and modify code from the internet. 
			Right now the gallery is very simple. You can right click and open the images in a new tab for a better view.
			<br><br>
			The website review assignment also made me think about website design. 
			I originally wasn't planning on a very elaborate navigation system 
			(since the site isn't practical so much as it's an experience in my vision). 
			However UI elements like navigation bars are still important, so I added one. 
			Also added a placeholderlogo (I will draw it later).
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			10/8: I've been really busy, so not much time (or energy) to code. 
			I've been working on non-code things, though. 
			I drew around 4 new backgrounds and made a website mock up on google slides to plan out the formatting.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			10/1: I figured out how to make the background change when I click tabs. 
			I drew characters and added them to the link on the right. 
			The page kind of breaks when the screen is not 1080x1920, though. I should fix that at some point.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p style="padding: 20px;">
			9/28 (check in 1): the website has basic functionality. The links work. 
			I know how to format pages and embed images now (even if the current design is very... minimal). 
			I also figured out clickable tabs + how to upload websites online. 
			In the future, I want to work on the actual content (text, image assets, art) for the site. 
			I want to make it look nicer. I'm thinking about making this an archive for a personal worldbuilding project. 
			I should also figure out the organization of the website. 
			If I have time at the end, I could attempt mobile compatibility.

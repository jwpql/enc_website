	9/28 (check in 1): the website has basic functionality. The links work. I know how to format pages and embed images now 
	(even if the current design is very... minimal). I also figured out clickable tabs + how to upload websites online.
	In the future, I want to work on the actual content (text, image assets, art) for the site. I want to make it look nicer. 
	I'm thinking about making this an archive for a personal worldbuilding project.
	I should also figure out the organization of the website. If I have time at the end, I could attempt mobile compatibility.
    <br/> <br/>
	10/1: I figured out how to make the background change when I click tabs!!!!! I drew characters and added them to the link on the right.
	I'm really proud of the art! The page kind of breaks when the screen is not 1080x1920, though. I should fix that at some point. 
	Making a to-do list below. 
	<br/><br/>
    10/8: I've been really busy, so not much time (or energy) to code. I've been working on non-code things, though. I drew around 4 new 
	backgrounds and made a website mock up on google slides to plan out the formatting.
	<br/><br/>
	TO DO: <br/>
	fix character page background window resizing<br/>
	button animations <br/>
	draw buttons <br/>
	draw more characters<br/>
	back buttons <br/>
	<br/>
	DONE: <br/>

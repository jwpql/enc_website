 <p>A world left behind. [] was the magnum opus of the Creator, also called the Earth, who sculpted plants and breathed 
    life into animals, which populate its body. Uncountable cycles of life closely intertwined with a benevolent Creator 
    passed (a time broadly referred to as the Ancient World), until, without warning, the Creator died.
    <br/><br/>
    All life on the Creator was sustained by its power. Without it, nothing should have been left. The Creator had put 
    so much into their art, however, that some of its power lingered in some of the creations it loved so dearly. In the 
    dead world, pockets of life persisted, and eventually grew into civilization. Such began the New World.
